# FlappyFlap Bird

This is a simple implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird using the LÖVE 2D framework. It was developed as a learning exercise for understanding the LÖVE 2D framework and Lua programming language.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you'll need to have LÖVE 2D installed on your system. Follow the official [LÖVE 2D website](https://love2d.org/) for instructions on installing LÖVE 2D for your specific platform.

Once you have LÖVE 2D installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappyflap-bird.git
cd flappyflap-bird
```

To start the game, simply drag the directory to LÖVE 2D application.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The bird automatically moves forward, and the player can make it "flap" by pressing the spacebar or clicking the mouse (soon I will implement that feature too). Each successful passage through a pair of pipes earns the player one point, and colliding with a pipe ends the game.

## Controls

Use the following controls to play the game:

- **Spacebar**: Flap (make the bird jump)
- **Escape**: Quit the game
